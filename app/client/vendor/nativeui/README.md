### NOTE BRIEFLY:

* The description and optimizationÂ updates for me saved over 20-30 FPS while a menu is open.
* You might want to be careful with menu pools right now. I haven't went deep into it but for simple menu pools it works GREAT.
* `MenuClose` event is NOT emitted when Visible is set to false. This is to allow users to reopen menus at it's same state, for e.g searching through a store.
